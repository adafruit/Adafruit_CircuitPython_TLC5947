    """TLC5947 12-bit 24 channel LED PWM driver.  Create an instance of this by
    passing in at least the following parameters:

    :param spi: The SPI bus connected to the chip (only the SCK and MOSI lines are
                used, there is no MISO/input).
    :param latch: A DigitalInOut instance connected to the chip's latch line.

    Optionally you can specify:

    :param auto_write: This is a boolean that defaults to True and will automatically
                       write out all the channel values to the chip as soon as a
                       single one is updated.  If you set to False to disable then
                       you MUST call write after every channel update or when you
                       deem necessary to update the chip state.

    :param num_drivers: This is an integer that defaults to 1. It stands for the
                        number of chained LED driver boards (DOUT of one board has
                        to be connected to DIN of the next). For each board added,
                        36 bytes of RAM memory will be taken. The channel numbers
                        on the driver directly connected to the controller are 0 to
                        23, and for each driver add 24 to the port number printed.
                        The more drivers are chained, the more viable it is to set
                        auto_write=False, and call write explicitly after updating
                        all the channels.
